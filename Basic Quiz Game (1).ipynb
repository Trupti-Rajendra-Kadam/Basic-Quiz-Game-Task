    "First, a game that we will call A, which is a simple coin flip with a biased coin (tails with a probability of p=0.49). The player bets one dollar and flips the coin: if they get tails, they win one dollar and recoup their bet, otherwise they lose their bet. Then, a game that we will call B, which is a game with two biased coins. The first coin gives tails with probability p1 = 0.09 and the second coin gives tails with probability p2 = 0.74. The player can only bet one dollar at a time! However, at each flip, we look at the player's total amount of money to determine which coin to flip: if the amount is a multiple of three, we flip the first coin, otherwise we flip the second coin. As in game A, the player recoups their bet plus an extra dollar if the chosen coin lands on tails, otherwise they lose their bet. A game is considered won when a player finishes with more money than they started with after playing a large number of rounds (e.g., several hundred). Implement these two games of chance with Python, using the libraries seen earlier, considering that the player starts with a capital of $1,000.\n",
